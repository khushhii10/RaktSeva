                    <span class="icon">+</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, donating blood is safe. Blood donation procedures are strictly regulated and carried out
                        using sterile, single-use equipment to eliminate any risk of infection. Health professionals
                        carefully assess your suitability before each donation, and blood is thoroughly tested for
                        diseases like HIV, hepatitis, and syphilis. While some people may feel light-headed or
                        experience minor discomfort, these symptoms are typically short-lived and rarely lead to serious
                        complications.</p>

                    <h3>What happens to the blood after donation?</h3>
                    <span class="icon">+</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p> After blood is collected, it is sent to a blood bank or hospital where it is tested for any
                        infections or diseases. Once cleared, the blood is separated into its components (red blood
                        cells, plasma, and platelets). These components are then stored in specific conditions and used
                        for patients in need. Red blood cells are used for surgeries, trauma patients, and anemia;
                        plasma is used for burn victims and patients with clotting disorders; and platelets are used in
                        cancer treatments and for patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
